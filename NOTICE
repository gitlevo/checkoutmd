IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

This software manages sensitive credentials (API keys, payment tokens, secrets)
on behalf of its users. By using this software, you acknowledge and agree:

1. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This software is provided as-is, without warranty of
   any kind. You are solely responsible for the security of your credentials,
   the configuration of your policies, and any actions taken by AI agents using
   credentials obtained through this software.

2. NO GUARANTEE OF SECURITY. While this software implements encryption
   (AES-256-GCM) and key derivation (Argon2id), no software can guarantee
   absolute security. This implementation has not undergone a formal third-party
   security audit. You should evaluate whether it meets your security
   requirements before storing real credentials.

3. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. If you configure this software to provide payment
   tokens or other financial credentials to AI agents, you are solely responsible
   for any charges, transactions, or financial losses that result. Budget limits
   and spending controls are best-effort safeguards, not guarantees.

4. NOT A COMPLIANCE SOLUTION. This software is not certified under PCI-DSS,
   SOC 2, HIPAA, or any other regulatory framework. If your use case requires
   regulatory compliance, you must evaluate and ensure compliance independently.

5. AGENT BEHAVIOR. This software provides a governance layer for AI agent
   credential access, but it cannot control or guarantee agent behavior. Agents
   may misuse credentials within the scope granted to them. Policy configuration
   is your responsibility.

6. PASSPHRASE RESPONSIBILITY. Your vault passphrase is the sole protection for
   your encrypted credentials. If you lose your passphrase, your credentials
   cannot be recovered. If your passphrase is compromised, your credentials
   should be considered compromised.

This notice does not modify the Apache License, Version 2.0 under which this
